This section will go over the necessary steps for integrating crowdin for translations.

### Prerequisites
1. You need to have a crowdin account. If you don't have one, you can create one [here](https://crowdin.com/).
2. You need to have a crowdin project. If you don't have one, you can create one [here](https://crowdin.com/project/create)
3. You need to host your project on github. If you don't have one, you can create one [here](https://github.com)

### خطوات
1. Generate the documentation using JSquarton. You can follow the steps @crowdin-documentation
2. Add a `config.json` file to the root of your project. The file should look like this:

   ```json
        {
            "outputDirectory": "docs",
            "languages": ["en", "ar"],
            "translationsDirectory": "translations"
        }
    ```
    
    - `outputDirectory`: The directory where the generated documentation will be stored.
    - `languages`: An array of the languages you want to support.
    - `translationsDirectory`: The directory where the translations will be stored. This directory will be used by crowdin to store the translations.
    
    Make sure the `outputDirectory` and `translationsDirectory` exists within your project
3. Commit all necessary changes, including the `config.json` file and push to your github repository.
4. On your crowdin project, go to the settings page and click on the `Integrations` tab.
   ![Integrations]('../images/open_integrations_tab.png')
5. Search for Github integration and click on the `Install` button.
   ![Github Integration]('../images/search_github_integration.png')
6. Go back to the integrations tab and select find the Github integration then click `Set Up Integration`
   ![Set Up Integration]('../images/open_integrations_tab.png')
7. Click the dropdown menu for `Set Up Integration` and select the `Source and translation files mode`
   ![Source and translation files mode]('../images/source_and_translation_mode.png')
8. Fill the repository details, specify the branch for translations and translation mode.
   ![Repository Details]('../images/select_github_repo.png')
9. Now go back to the Integrations tab and select Github Integration.
