# Welcome to JSQuarto Documentation

## About

JSQuarto is a tool designed to generate JavaScript package API reference documentation using Markdown and Quarto. It serves as an alternative to JSDoc, providing a simpler and more flexible approach for documenting JavaScript code.

## Purpose

The purpose of JSQuarto is to streamline the process of generating API reference documentation for JavaScript packages. By leveraging Markdown and Quarto, developers can easily create and maintain comprehensive documentation for their JavaScript projects.

## Inspiration

JSQuarto draws inspiration from various documentation tools and methodologies, including:  </br>

- [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/): JSDoc is a popular tool for generating API documentation from JavaScript source code. </br>
- [Quarto](https://quarto.org/): Quarto is a versatile document authoring and publishing tool that supports Markdown, LaTeX, and R Markdown formats. </br>
- [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/): Sphinx is a documentation generation tool widely used in the Python community. </br>

## Localization and Translation

JSQuarto is committed to supporting localization and translation of generated documentation. We are planning to integrate Crowdin, a localization management platform, to facilitate translation efforts. This will enable users to present the generated QMD files in multiple languages, making documentation accessible to a wider audience.
