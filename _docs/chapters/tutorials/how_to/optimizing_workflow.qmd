### Understanding Source Files
In the context of JSquarto, source files are pivotal components containing the comments that JSquarto utilizes to generate comprehensive documentation. These files can be authored in various languages supported by JSquarto, such as JavaScript, TypeScript, and JSX. By default, JSquarto scrutinizes the `/source_files` directory within your project structure to locate these crucial files. However, you possess the flexibility to designate an alternative directory through the `--source` option.

Specifying Source Files Location
To specify a custom directory containing your source files, employ the `--source` option when executing JSquarto commands. Here's an example demonstrating its usage:

    ```bash
    npm run build --source /path/to/your/source/files
    ```

In this example, the `--source` option is utilized to specify the `/path/to/your/source/files` directory as the location of the source files. Consequently, JSquarto will scrutinize this directory to locate the source files and generate the documentation.


### Leveraging TypeScript in Source Files
When utilizing TypeScript within your project, it's advisable to transpile your TypeScript source files into JavaScript before initiating the JSquarto process. This recommendation stems from the fact that JSquarto lacks intrinsic support for TypeScript syntax. Once you've transpiled your TypeScript files into JavaScript, you can seamlessly execute JSquarto on the resultant JavaScript files to generate comprehensive documentation.

Integrating TypeScript Transpilation
Prior to executing JSquarto, ensure to transpile your TypeScript source files into JavaScript using your preferred transpiler, such as TypeScript Compiler (tsc). This step ensures compatibility with JSquarto's documentation generation process, thereby facilitating a smooth and efficient
