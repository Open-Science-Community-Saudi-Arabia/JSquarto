    "text": "Effective documentation is crucial for maintaining a clear and understandable codebase. One powerful tool for enhancing documentation within your code is JSDoc. JSDoc is a markup language that allows you to annotate your code with structured comments, enabling automatic generation of documentation. In this guide, we will explore the uses of JSDoc and how it can improve your project’s documentation.\n\nUsing JSDoc for Generated Documentation\n\nOne of the primary uses of JSDoc is to generate documentation directly from your codebase. By adding JSDoc comments to your functions, classes, and variables, you can provide essential information that is automatically extracted and transformed into comprehensive documentation.\nTo use JSDoc for generating documentation, follow these steps:\n\nMarkup Comments: Add JSDoc comments directly above the code elements you want to document. Use the /*_ … _/ syntax to indicate a JSDoc comment block.\nDocumenting Functions: Use JSDoc tags to describe function parameters, return values, and additional information. Tags like @param, @returns, and @description are commonly used for this purpose.  Other important custom tags are @category and @subcategory, these tags help to structure the generated documentation into chapters.\n\n@category: This tag is used to group modules under a common chapter. All modules under a category will be under one chapter, the chapter name will correspond to the name assigned to the category.\n@subcategory: This tag is used to group modules under a common chapter. All modules under a subcategory will be under one chapter, the chapter name will correspond to the name assigned to the subcategory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocumenting Classes: For classes, use JSDoc comments to provide descriptions, document class properties, and document class methods. Tags like @class, @property, and @method are commonly used in this context.\nRunning JSDoc Generation: Use a JSDoc generator tool, such as JSDoc itself or other popular tools like TypeDoc or JSDoc3, to parse your codebase and generate the documentation output. Configure the generator to target the desired output format, such as HTML or Markdown.\nReview and Update: Review the generated documentation and ensure it accurately represents your code. Update the JSDoc comments as needed to provide clearer explanations or additional information.\n\nFor more information on using JSDoc for generating documentation, see the JSDoc documentation or Getting started with JSDoc.\n\n\nUsing JSDoc for Writing Documentation\n\nJSDoc can also be used beyond generating code documentation. Its flexible syntax and tagging system make it a valuable tool for writing other aspects of your project’s documentation, such as tutorials, guides, and reference materials.\nTo use JSDoc for writing documentation, consider the following approaches:\n\nTutorials and Guides: Utilize JSDoc comments to write step-by-step tutorials and guides within your codebase. By embedding tutorial content in JSDoc comments, you can keep the documentation closely tied to the relevant code, making it easier for developers to follow along and understand the concepts.\nInline Examples: Use JSDoc comments to include inline code examples that demonstrate the usage of functions, classes, or modules. These examples can serve as both instructional material and a quick reference for developers.\nReference Materials: JSDoc comments can be used to provide additional information in reference materials, such as explaining design patterns, outlining best practices, or clarifying complex concepts. Leverage JSDoc tags like @example or @see to link to relevant resources or code examples.\nIntegration with Markdown: JSDoc supports Markdown within comments, allowing you to incorporate formatted text, headings, lists, and other Markdown features into your documentation. This enables you to create more visually appealing and structured content within your JSDoc comments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImproving JSQuarto documentation with JSDoc\n\nThe JSQuarto documentation is not yet complete. There are several areas that could be improved, including:\n\nMore detailed explanations of the JSQuarto project structure and codebase\nAdditional information on how to contribute to the project\nAdditional information on how to maintain the JSQuarto project\nAdditional information on how to deploy the JSQuarto project\nProject roadmap and future plans\n\nTo improve the JSQuarto documentation, you can use JSDoc to add additional documentation directly within the codebase. This will allow you to provide more detailed explanations of the code and project structure, as well as additional information on how to contribute to the project, how to use the JSQuarto API, and how to maintain and deploy the project. As at the time of writing this, the documentation was built with other packages to improve the User interface, one of which is Better-docs.",

    "text": "Raising issues is an essential part of contributing to an open source project. Before you start, it’s recommended that you have a basic understanding of Markdown and GitHub, which are commonly used in this workflow. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is used to format and style text on the web. You can find a comprehensive guide to Markdown on the GitHub website\nIf you’re not familiar with GitHub, it’s a web-based platform that provides tools for version control, code management, and collaboration. GitHub provides a step-by-step guide to getting started with their platform on their website\nIt’s important to check whether your idea or issue has already been raised by someone else. You can do this by searching through the project’s existing issues on GitHub. If you find an issue that is similar to yours, please comment on it to let others know that you’re also interested in working on it.\nIf the issue has already been closed, or if it only partially solves your problem, it’s recommended that you open a new issue with a reference to the old one. This can help to keep the discussion organized and ensure that all relevant information is easily accessible.\nRemember, raising an issue is an opportunity to improve the project and contribute to the open source community. With a little bit of effort and attention to detail, you can help make a real difference\n\nIssue templates\nWe have issue templates for different types of issues. Please use the appropriate template for your issue. If you’re not sure which template to use, please use the General template.\n\nGeneral template (preview) : This is the default template for raising an issue. Use this template if you’re not sure which template to use.\nBug report template (preview) : Use this template to report a bug or problem with the project.\nNew feature Request template (preview) : Use this template to request permission to add a new course to the list.\n\n\n\nWriting a clear title and description\nWhen opening an issue, it’s important to write a clear and concise title that accurately reflects the problem or suggestion you want to raise. The title should be descriptive enough so that others can quickly understand the issue, but not too long or complicated.\nIn the issue description, provide as much detail as possible about the issue or suggestion. Include steps to reproduce the problem if applicable, and any relevant information or context that can help others understand the issue better.\n\n\nUsing Issue labels\nIssue labels are used to categorize and organize issues in an open source project. They can help contributors quickly identify the type and status of an issue, and can also help maintainers prioritize and manage the project’s backlog of issues.\nWhen raising an issue, make sure to choose the appropriate label(s) that best describes the issue. For example, if you’re reporting a bug, you might use the “bug” label. If you’re suggesting a new feature or improvement, you might use the “enhancement” label.\nSome common issue labels you might see in a GitHub project include:\n\nBug: Used to report an error or problem with the code or functionality of the project.\nEnhancement: Used to suggest a new feature or improvement to the project.\nDocumentation: Used to suggest changes or improvements to the project’s documentation.\nHelp wanted: Used to indicate that the project maintainers are actively seeking contributions to help resolve the issue.\nGood first issue: Used to indicate that the issue is suitable for new contributors who are just getting started with the project.\n\n\n\nContributing to issue discussions\nIf you’re interested in working on an issue, please leave a comment to let others know. This will help to avoid duplicate work and ensure that the issue is assigned to the right person. Once you’ve opened an issue or commented on an existing one, it’s important to actively participate in the discussion. This means responding to comments and questions from others, providing additional information or clarification if needed, and being open to feedback and suggestions.\n\n\nConclusion\nRaising issues is an important part of contributing to open source projects. By following these guidelines, you can help ensure that your issue is clear, well-documented, and easy for others to understand. Remember to actively participate in discussions, follow up on issues, and contribute code if you’re able to. With a little effort and collaboration, we can all help make open source projects better for everyone.",

    "text": "Tutorials guide\n\nThis section provides an overview of the config.json files used in the JSQuarto documentation, specifically focusing on the tutorials folder. The config.json file serve as configuration files that help structure and organize the documentation, while the tutorials folder contains the Markdown files for various tutorials.\n\n\nThe tutorials Folder\n\nThe tutorials folder within the documentation directory is dedicated to hosting tutorials on various topics related to the JSQuarto platform. This folder contains a collection of Markdown files, each representing an individual tutorial.\nMarkdown is a lightweight markup language that allows for easy formatting and structuring of text, making it ideal for creating tutorials. Markdown files provide a simple yet powerful way to document step-by-step instructions, code examples, explanations, and other relevant information.\nThe tutorials folder can be organized into subfolders to further categorize and group related tutorials. This helps users easily locate and access the tutorials they need based on their specific interests or requirements.\nBy structuring tutorials within the tutorials folder using Markdown, contributors can contribute new tutorials, update existing ones, and ensure that the documentation remains comprehensive and user-friendly.\nOverall, the combination of .json files and the tutorials folder enables a well-organized and accessible documentation structure, allowing users to navigate and explore the JSQuarto platform documentation with ease.\n\n\nOverview of config.json Files\n\nThe config.json file in the JSQuarto documentation play a crucial role in organizing and categorizing the content. This file define the structure of the documentation and provide metadata for each section, tutorial, or topic. They allow maintainers and contributors to easily navigate and manage the documentation by specifying titles, creating nested structures, and linking related topics.\nBy using config.json file, the documentation can be dynamically generated and updated based on the defined structure. This makes it easier to maintain consistency, track changes, and add new content.\n\n\nThe .json configuration\n\nLet’s explain how this structure works by looking at the config.json file in the tutorials / folder. This file defines the structure of the tutorials section of the documentation, including the titles, descriptions links for each tutorial.\n{\n  \"changelog\": {\n    \"title\": \"Changelog\"\n  },\n  \"environment_setup\": {\n    \"title\": \"Environment Setup\"\n  },\n  \"contributing\": {\n    \"title\": \"Contributing\"\n  }\n}\nIn this example, the .json file defines the titles and relationships of the main sections within your documentation. The sections are represented as objects, with each object having a unique key and a \"title\" key-value pair.\n\nchangelog represents the “Changelog” section. The \"title\" key-value pair specifies the title of this section as “Changelog.”\nenvironment_setup represents the “Environment Setup” section. The \"title\" key-value pair specifies the title of this section as “Environment Setup.”\ncontributing represents the “Contributing” section. The \"title\" key-value pair specifies the title of this section as “Contributing.”\n\nWith this structure, your documentation folder will contain separate Markdown files for each section, named according to the keys in the .json file. For example:\n- `documentation /`\n    - `docs /`\n        - `changelog.md`\n        - `environment_setup.md`\n        - `contributing.md`\n        - `tutorials.json`\nEach Markdown file will correspond to a section in your documentation and should contain the relevant content for that section.\nRemember to update the .json file whenever you add or modify sections to ensure that the documentation structure accurately reflects the content of your documentation.\n\n\nNested .json configuration for tutorials\n\nTo structure tutorials and create nested tutorials within your documentation, you can use the .json file to define the hierarchy and relationships between tutorials. Here’s an example of how you can structure tutorials using a .json file:\n{\n    \"maintainers\": {\n        \"title\": \"Technical guide for Maintainers\",\n        \"children\": {\n            \"reviewing_pr\": {\n                \"title\": \"Reviewing pull requests\"\n            },\n            \"ci_workflow\": {\n                \"title\": \"CI Workflow\"\n            },\n            \"secrets_and_security\": {\n                \"title\": \"Secret Access/Management\"\n            },\n            \"deployment_guide\": {\n                \"title\": \"Deployment Guide\"\n            }\n        }\n    },\n    \"contributing\": {\n        \"title\": \"Contributing to the project\",\n        \"children\": {\n            \"adding_a_course\": {\n                \"title\": \"Adding a course\"\n            },\n            \"api_project_structure\": {\n                \"title\": \"API project structure\"\n            },\n            \"improving_documentation\": {\n                \"title\": \"Improving documentation\"\n            },\n            \"project_structure\": {\n                \"title\": \"Project structure\"\n            },\n            \"raising_issues\": {\n                \"title\": \"Raising issues\"\n            },\n            \"raising_pr\": {\n                \"title\": \"Raising pull requests\"\n            }\n        }\n    },\n    \"review\": {\n        \"title\": \"Reviewing the project\"\n    }\n}\nIn this example, the .json file represents a documentation structure with two main sections: “Technical guide for Maintainers” and “Technical guide for API developers”. Each section has its own set of tutorials represented as nested objects.\n\nDefine the main sections or categories as top-level objects within the .json file, such as “maintainers” and “contributing”.\nWithin each main section, provide a \"title\" key to specify the title or heading for that section. For example, “Technical guide for Maintainers” and “Technical guide for API developers”.\nAdd a \"children\" key within each main section to define the nested tutorials. Each tutorial is represented as a child object within the \"children\" object. Not all tutorials may have children tutorials, an example of this is the review tutorial. Since it has no children the program will only look for a review.qmd file and not a review folder\nFor each tutorial, provide a unique key as the object’s key, such as “reviewing_pr” and “ci_workflow”.\nWithin each tutorial object, include a \"title\" key to specify the title or heading for that specific tutorial.\n\nFor this example here is what the folder structure would look like assuming the root folder is tutorials /:\n        - tutorials/\n            - maintainers/\n                - maintainers.qmd\n                - reviewing_pr.qmd\n                - ci_workflow.qmd\n                - secrets_and_security.qmd\n                - deployment_guide.qmd\n\n            - contributing/\n                - api.md\n                - api_structure.md\n                - api_authentication_flow.qmd\n                - jwt_token_management.qmd\n                - rbac_handler_flow.qmd\n            \n            - review.qmd\n              \n            - config.json\nIn this structure:\n\nThe .json configuration file is located in the tutorials/ folder\nThe tutorials folder contains subfolders representing different sections or categories of tutorials.\nEach section or category folder, such as maintainers and contributing, contains the .qmd files for individual tutorials. \n\nThe nested structure allows you to organize tutorials hierarchically, making it easier to navigate and find specific tutorials based on their topic or category.\nIt’s important to note that the tutorial structure allows only one level of nesting. This means you can have main sections and their respective tutorials, but you cannot create further nested folders within the tutorials.",

    "text": "Tutorials are a great way to teach people how to use your project. They are a step-by-step guide that walks the user through a specific task or concept. Tutorials are a great way to get people up and running with your project, and to help them understand how to use it.\n\nHow tutorials are written\nTutorials are written in Quarto markdown. Quarto is a markdown language that is designed to be easy to write and read, and to be easy to convert to other formats. Quarto is a superset of markdown, so any markdown file is a valid quarto file. Quarto adds a few features to markdown to make it easier to write tutorials. Some of the features include:\n\nThe ability to include code and output in the same file\nThe ability to include code from other files\nAdding metadata / images and other content to the file\n\n\n\nFolder to write the tutorial\nBy default, tutorials are written in the docs/tutorials folder. This is the folder where all the tutorials are stored. Each tutorial is stored in a separate folder, and the folder name is the name of the tutorial. Inside the folder, there are serveral .qmd files that contains the tutorial contents.\n\n\nConfiguring the tutorial\nThere is also a config.json file that contains the configuration for the tutorial. The config.json file is used to structure how the tutorial is displayed in terms of the order of the tutorial, the title, the description, and the grouping of the tutorial.\nBelow is an example of a config.json file:\n{\n    \"contributing\": {\n        \"title\": \"Contributing to the project\",\n        \"children\": {\n            \"improving_documentation\": {\n                \"title\": \"Improving documentation\"\n            },\n            \"raising_issues\": {\n                \"title\": \"Raising issues\"\n            },\n            \"raising_pr\": {\n                \"title\": \"Raising pull requests\"\n            }\n        }\n    },\n    \"project_structure\": {\n        \"title\": \"Project structure\"\n    },\n    \"environment_setup\": {\n        \"title\": \"Environment Setup\"\n    },\n    \"changelog\": {\n        \"title\": \"Change log\"\n    },\n    \"localization\": {\n        \"title\": \"Localization\"\n    },\n    \"how_to\": {\n        \"title\": \"How to's\",\n        \"children\": {\n            \"setting_default_readme\": {\n                \"title\": \"Setting default README\"\n            },\n            \"adding_tutorials\": {\n                \"title\": \"Adding tutorials\"\n            },\n            \"specifying_source_files\": {\n                \"title\": \"Specifying source files\"\n            },\n            \"starting_a_new_build\": {\n                \"title\": \"Starting a new build\"\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\nIn the example above, the config.json file contains a list of tutorials and the order in which they should be displayed. The config.json file also contains the title of the tutorial and the description of the tutorial.\nThe config.json file also contains a list of children for each tutorial. This is used to group tutorials together. For example, in the example above, the contributing tutorial has three children: improving_documentation, raising_issues, and raising_pr. This groups the three tutorials together under the contributing tutorial.\n\n\nGrouping tutorials\nTutorials can be grouped together using the config.json file. This is useful for organizing tutorials into categories. For example, you might want to group all the tutorials related to contributing to the project together, or all the tutorials related to setting up the environment together. This makes it easier for users to find the tutorials they are interested in.\nIn the example above, the config.json file groups the tutorials into categories such as contributing, project_structure, environment_setup, changelog, localization, and how_to. Each of these categories contains a list of tutorials, and each tutorial contains a list of children. This allows you to organize the tutorials in a way that makes sense for your project.\nIn this tutorial, we learned how to write tutorials in Quarto markdown, and how to configure the config.json file to structure how the tutorial is displayed. We also learned how to group tutorials together using the config.json file. This allows you to organize the tutorials in a way that makes sense for your project, and makes it easier for users to find the tutorials they are interested in.\nSummary - How tutorials are written - Format for writing tutorials - How to write a tutorial - Folder to write the tutorial",

    "title": "Usage",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This section provides an overview of the JSquarto tool and its usage, including the custom CLI arguments and configuration settings that can be leveraged to customize the documentation generation process.\n\nCLI arguments\n\nThe CLI arguments are used to customize the behavior of the JSquarto tool. These bespoke arguments enable you to tailor the documentation generation process to suit your specific requirements. By leveraging these arguments, you can enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the documentation generation process, thereby streamlining your workflow and optimizing your documentation output.\nSome of the custom CLI arguments supported by JSquarto include:\n\nsource: Specifies the directory containing the source files to be documented. These files can be can be written in various languages supported by JSquarto, such as JavaScript, TypeScript, and JSX. By default, JSquarto will check for the docs/source directory within your project structure to locate these the source file. However, you possess the flexibility to specify an alternative directory through the source option.\ntutorial: Specifies the directory containing the tutorial files to be included in the documentation. This argument allows you to incorporate tutorial content into your documentation, providing additional context and guidance for users.\noutput: Specifies the output directory where the generated documentation will be stored. By default, JSquarto will save the documentation in the docs directory within your project structure. However, you can customize the output location by specifying an alternative directory through the output option.\nlanguages: Specifies the languages to be supported in the documentation. This argument enables you to generate documentation in multiple languages, catering to a diverse user base. For example, languages=en,fr,es specifies English, French, and Spanish as the supported languages.\ninclude_localized_versions: Specifies whether to include localized versions of the generated documentation. For example, if specified, JSquarto will generate seperate files for each specified language.\n\n\n\nConfiguration\n\nThe config.json file in the root directory of the project is used to store the configuration settings for the JSquarto tool. This file contains the default settings for the documentation generation process, such as the source files directory, tutorial files directory, output directory, and supported languages. This config file can come in handy when you want to persist your settings for a particular project. You can modify these settings to customize the documentation generation process according to your preferences.\nBelow is an example of the config.json file:\n{\n    \"includeLocalizedVersions\": false,\n    \"outputDirectory\": \"docs/output\",\n    \"sourceDirectory\": \"docs/source\",\n    \"tutorialDirectory\": \"docs/tutorials\",\n    \"languages\": [\"en\", \"ar\"],\n    \"translationsDirectory\": \"dosc/translations\"\n}\nIt contains the following fields:\n\nsourceDirectory: Specifies the directory containing the source files to be documented. By default, this field is set to docs/source within the project structure. This is the same as the source CLI argument.\ntutorialDirectory: Specifies the directory containing the tutorial files to be included in the documentation. By default, this field is set to docs/tutorials within the project structure. This is the same as the tutorial CLI argument.\noutputDirectory: Specifies the output directory where the generated documentation will be stored. By default, this field is set to docs/output within the project structure. This is the same as the output CLI argument.\n\n\n\nBasic Usage\n\nTo utilize these custom CLI arguments, simply append them to the JSquarto command when executing the tool. For example:\nTo specify the source files directory:\njsq doc:generate source=/path/to/your/source/files \nTo specify the tutorial files directory:\njsq doc:generate tutorial=/path/to/your/tutorial/files\nTo specify the output directory:\njsq doc:generate output=/path/to/your/output/directory\nTo specify the supported languages:\njsq doc:generate languages=en,fr,es\nThis will only add the languages to the config file (_quarto.yml) and not generate the documentation in the specified languages. This is important for cases where an external tool like Crowdin will be used to translate the documentation and generate the files in the specified languages.\nTo include localized versions of the generated documentation:\njsq doc:generate include_localized_versions=true languages=en,fr,es\nThis will generate the documentation in the specified languages and also add the languages to the config file (_quarto.yml).\nNote: If you intend to include_localized_versions, you must also specify the languages argument to indicate the supported languages for the documentation.\n\n\nUsage with Configuration File\n\nAlternatively, you can leverage the config.json file to store your custom settings and avoid specifying them each time you run the JSquarto tool. By modifying the fields in the config.json file, you can customize the documentation generation process according to your requirements.\nTo use a configuration file follow the steps below:\n\nInitialize the configuration file using the command below:\njsq config:init  \nThis will create a config.json file in the .jsquarto directory within your project structure. You might have an already existing config file, for this case you can tell jsq to use this file instead by running;\njsq config:set config=/path/to/your/directory\nSet the desired configuration settings in the config.json file according to your preferences. To set the source files directory run\njsq config:set source=/path/to/your/source/files\nTo set the tutorial files directory run\njsq config:set tutorial=/path/to/your/tutorial/files\nTo set the output directory run\njsq config:set output=/path/to/your/output/directory\nTo set the supported languages run\njsq config:set languages=en,fr,es\nTo include localized versions of the generated documentation run\njsq config:set include_localized_versions=true\n\nThis will update the config.json file with the specified settings, which will be used by the JSquarto tool during the documentation generation process.\nYou can also manually edit the config.json file to modify the configuration settings according to your requirements.\n\n\n\nNote: - After initializing a config file the default configuration will be added to the file. You can then modify the settings in the file to suit your needs.\n\nYour config.json file location will be stored by jsquarto in cache, so you don’t have to specify the file location each time you run jsquarto. It is stored together with your project directory (the directory where jsq command is run).\nEven when you have multiple projects, jsquarto will store the config file location for each project separately. This means that you can have different config files for different projects.\nIf you already initialized a config file for project, and you want to use a different config file for the same project, you can run the command below:\njsq config:set config=/path/to/your/directory force\nThis will update the config file location for the project.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeveraging TypeScript in Source Files\n\nWhen utilizing TypeScript within your project, it’s advisable to transpile your TypeScript source files into JavaScript before initiating the JSquarto process. This recommendation stems from the fact that JSquarto lacks intrinsic support for TypeScript syntax. Once you’ve transpiled your TypeScript files into JavaScript, you can seamlessly execute JSquarto on the resultant JavaScript files to generate comprehensive documentation.\nIntegrating TypeScript Transpilation Prior to executing JSquarto, ensure to transpile your TypeScript source files into JavaScript using your preferred transpiler, such as TypeScript Compiler (tsc). This step ensures compatibility with JSquarto’s documentation generation process, thereby facilitating a smooth and efficient",

    "text": "There are different workflows that can be adopted to optimize the documentation generation process using JSquarto.\n\nDoc generation\nDoc generation with manual transalation\nDoc generation with crowdin translation\n\n\nDoc generation\n\nThis workflow involves generating documentation in a single language. The process is straightforward and involves executing JSquarto on the source files to generate comprehensive documentation in the specified language. This workflow is ideal for projects targeting a specific language audience and seeking to streamline the documentation generation process.\n\nSTEPS\n\nTo do this, simply execute the JSquarto command with the desired custom CLI arguments, such as source and languages, to specify the source files directory and supported languages, respectively. For example:\njsq doc:generate source=/path/to/your/source/files \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoc generation with manual translation\n\nFor manual translation of the documentation, you can generate the documentation in multiple languages and then manually translate the content into the desired languages. For this workflow, we use babelquarto which helps to preview the documentation in multiple languages. Although this doesn’t translate the content, it provides a preview of the documentation in the specified languages, enabling you to manually translate the content.\n\nSTEPS\n\nGenerate the documentation in multiple languages using JSquarto with the languages argument to specify the supported languages. For example:\njsq doc:generate languages=en,fr,es include_localized_versions source=/path/to/your/source/files\nNote: Ensure to include the include_localized_versions argument to generate copies of the documentation in the specified languages. If they are not included, only the default language documentation will be generated. But the languages config will only be added to the config (_quarto.yml) file.\nManually translate the content in the generated documentation files for each language. You can leverage tools such as Google Translate or professional translation services to facilitate the translation process.\nDownload RStudio and install the babelquarto package from CRAN. This package is used to preview the documentation in multiple languages. You can install the package using the following command:\n install.packages('babelquarto', repos = c('https://ropensci.r-universe.dev', 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))\nOpen the generated doc folder in RStudio, navigate to the console and set the working directory to the doc folder.\n project_dir &lt;- \"/home/richie/Desktop/repos/oscsa/JSquarto/docs\"\nPreview the documentation in multiple languages using the babelquarto package. For example, to preview the documentation in English, French, and Spanish, execute the following command:\nbabelquarto::render_book(file.path(parent_dir, project_dir))\nAs at the time of writing this, there are minor issues with navigating the previewed documentation in different languages. To fix this temporarily, run\njsq fix:all languages=en,fr,es\nNote: The fix:all script is a custom script that fixes the navigation issues in the previewed documentation. This script is used to update the navigation links in the previewed documentation to enable seamless navigation between the different languages. And the languages specified in the script should match the languages specified in the languages argument during the documentation generation process.\nYou can navigate to the docs/output/_book directory to view the previewed documentation in multiple languages. The previewed documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the content in each language, enabling you to verify the translations and ensure the accuracy and quality of the documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoc generation with crowdin translation\n\nFor automated translation of the documentation, you can leverage the Crowdin platform to facilitate the translation process. Crowdin is a cloud-based translation management platform that enables you to automate the translation of content into multiple languages. By integrating Crowdin with JSquarto, you can streamline the translation process and generate comprehensive documentation in various languages efficiently.\n\nSTEPS\n\nGenerate the documentation in multiple languages using JSquarto with the languages argument to specify the supported languages. For example:\njsq doc:generate languages=en,fr,es source=/path/to/your/source/files\nNote that the include_localized_versions argument is not required for this workflow, as Crowdin will handle the translation process. And generate the different files for each language.\nIntegrate Crowdin with JSquarto to automate the translation process. To integrate Crowdin, you need to create a Crowdin project and configure the project settings to enable the automatic translation of the documentation. You can refer to the Crowdin Github integration documentation for detailed instructions on setting up a project and configuring the translation settings On Crowdin, you can set up how the translated files will be named, make sure it follows the format original_file_name.locale.extension e.g index.en.qmd, index.fr.qmd, index.es.qmd\nOnce you’ve configured the Crowdin project settings, you can proceed to render the documentation in multiple languages using the babelquarto package. This step enables you to preview the documentation in different languages before initiating the translation process. You can leverage the babelquarto package to preview the documentation in multiple languages, as described in the previous workflow. To do this open the generated doc folder in RStudio, navigate to the console and set the working directory to the doc folder.\nproject_dir &lt;- \"path/to/your/project/output/folder\"\nPreview the documentation in multiple languages using the babelquarto package. For example, to preview the documentation in English, French, and Spanish, execute the following command:\nbabelquarto::render_book(file.path(parent_dir, project_dir))\nAfter rendering the book, the html files will be generated and set in the docs/output/_book directory. You can then serve the book using any static server like http-server or live-server to preview the documentation in multiple languages. Alternatively, you can run the following command to serve the book:\njsq serve\nAfter serving the book, you can navigate to the specified URL to view the documentation in multiple languages. In some cases you may notice that the navigation links are not working as expected. To fix this, run the following command:\njsq fix:all languages=en,fr,es\n\nThis workflow uses JSquarto to generate the documentation, and Crowdin to initiate the translation process which creates the translated files in the specified languages, lastly the babelquarto package to preview the documentation in multiple languages.",

If you don’t have one, you can create one here\n\n\n\nSteps\n\nInitialize a new config file if you dont have one already. To do this run the following command:\njsq config:init\nThe file should look like this:\n     {\n         \"outputDirectory\": \"./docs/build\",\n         \"sourceDirectory\": \"./dist\",\n         \"translationsDirectory\": \"./docs/_translations\",\n     }\n\noutputDirectory: The directory where the generated documentation will be stored.\nlanguages: An array of the languages you want to support.\ntranslationsDirectory: The directory where the translations will be stored. This directory will be used by crowdin to store the translations.\n\nMake sure the outputDirectory and translationsDirectory exists within your project\nGenerate the documentation using JSquarto. You can follow the steps @usage-basic\nCommit all necessary changes, including the config.json file and push to your github repository.\nOn your crowdin project, go to the settings page and click on the Integrations tab. \nSearch for Github integration and click on the Install button. \nGo back to the integrations tab and select find the Github integration then click Set Up Integration \nClick the dropdown menu for Set Up Integration and select the Source and translation files mode \nFill the repository details, specify the branch for translations and translation mode. \nNow go back to the Integrations tab and select Github Integration. \nOn the integrations page, you’ll see your newlty created project. Open the branch configuration \nAdd Filters for the files you want to translate. You can add filters for the files in the translationsDirectory specified in the config.json file.  The filters tell crowdin which files to watch for and where to add the translations for each of them These are the configuration used are; \n\n\nSource files: /docs/build/**/*.qmd \nTranslated files path: /docs/_translations/%two_letters_code%/**/%file_name%.%two_letters_code%.qmd. \n**/*.qmd tells crowdin to match all files in subdirectories with the .qmd extension. \n\nNote that /docs/build and /docs/_translations/ correspond with the values we set for outputDirectory and translationsDirectory in the config.json file.\nUsing this configuration will ensure that the translations maintain the same structure as the source files. And each translation will be stored in a directory with the language code as the name.\n\nSave and proceed to setup the automated build using Github actions. Follow the guide here",
